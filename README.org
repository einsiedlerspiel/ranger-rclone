#+title: ranger-rclone-copy

Ranger Plugin to easily copy or move files to a remote location with rclone.

* Usage

#+begin_src
:rclone <command> <rclone-target>
#+end_src

Available ~<commands>~ are:

- ~copy~ :: https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/
- ~copyto~ :: https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copyto/
- ~move~ :: https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_move/
- ~moveto~ :: https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_moveto/

~<rclone-target>~ can be either a destination as you would provide to ~rclone copy~
directly or the key of a bookmarked destination.

Bookmarked destinations are a pair of a key and a destination. Bookmarks can be
defined via ~:add_rclone_target <key> <target>~, removed via ~:remove_rclone_target
<key>~ and the target to a key can be changed with ~:change_rclone_target <key>
<new-target>~.

The bookmarked targets are stored in a file in the ranger config directory that
is automatically created when a bookmark is added for the first time.

There is rudimentary tab completion for bookmarked targets.
