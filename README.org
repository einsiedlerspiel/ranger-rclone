#+title: ranger-rclone-copy

Ranger Plugin to easily copy or move files to a remote location with rclone.

* Usage

#+begin_src
:rclone <command> <rclone-target>
#+end_src

Available ~<commands>~ are:

- ~copy~ :: https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/
- ~copyto~ :: https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copyto/
- ~move~ :: https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_move/
- ~moveto~ :: https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_moveto/

~<rclone-target>~ can be either a destination as you would provide to ~rclone copy~
directly or the key of a bookmarked destination.

** Bookmarks

Bookmarked destinations are a pair of a key and a destination.

- add a bookmark :: ~:add_rclone_target <key> <target>~
- remove a bookmark :: ~:remove_rclone_target <key>~
- change target to existing key :: ~:change_rclone_target <key> <new-target>~

The bookmarked targets are stored in a file in the ranger config directory that
is automatically created when a bookmark is added for the first time.

There is rudimentary tab completion for bookmarked targets.
